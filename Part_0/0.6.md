    Note right of browser: The browser runs the JavaScript code that fetches the JSON from the server. The document.getElementById('notes_form') command fetches the form from the page and registers an event handler to handle the form submission. The handler creates a new note, adds it to the list with notes.push(note), re-renders the list on the page, and sends the new note to the server.
